        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.<strong><em>(Yields 1 serving)</em></strong></p>

            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet</li>
            <li>Spinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet</li>
            <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate</li>

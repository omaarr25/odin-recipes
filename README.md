# odin-recipes
My first Project!

With this project, I demonstrate that I can create a basic website, a main page, with relative links within the website itself. In addition, I've also used images with their descriptions, different types of headings, and nested elements, such as the strong and em. I also demonstrate that I can make ordered and unordered lists. I'm also capable of creating directories and their respective files from the terminal. In addition, I've also used Git and GitHub to create the repository, using git add + git commit.
